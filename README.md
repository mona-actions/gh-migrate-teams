# gh-migrate-teams

`gh-migrate-teams` is a [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com) extension to assist in the migration of teams between GitHub organizations. [GitHub Enterprise Importer](https://github.com/github/gh-gei) provides an excellent feature set when migrating organizations, but there are some gaps when it comes to migrating teams. This extension aims to fill those gaps. Wether you are consolidating organizations in an [EMU](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/identity-and-access-management/using-enterprise-managed-users-for-iam/about-enterprise-managed-users), or auditing teams and collaborators in an existing organization, this extension can help.
